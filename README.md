## 🤖 Machine Learning Workflow (Jupyter Notebook)

The machine learning notebook includes the following stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature encoding
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Revenue vs Budget
   - Genre distribution
   - Rating vs Revenue

3. **Modeling**
   - Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
   - Model evaluation using RMSE, R²

4. **Prediction**
   - Predicting movie revenue based on features like budget, runtime, genre, rating
